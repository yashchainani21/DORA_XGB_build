This is a custom-designed package built atop of several rdkit functionalities
The goal of this package is to provide various fingerprinting methods to featurize both compounds and reactions
Compounds can be featurized by converting their SMILES into either hashed fingerprints (ecfp4, atom-pair, MAP4)
or descriptor based fingerprints (Mordred and MACCS)
Reactions can be featurized by concatenating the fingerprints of constituent compounds together into a single vector
